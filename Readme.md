**The Counter App**
The Counter App can be used to record numbers of people visiting a train station, a park or for any other purpose as it is a multi-purpose app. 

What makes this app so interesting is its simplicity; very easy to use, and i really like it.

This is like the first major app i have built myself while still on a bootcamp course in software development and i will be building many more in coming days.

_And thank you for checking this out_
